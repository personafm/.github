# Welcome to Persona.fm!

Persona.fm is an open source web application that uses Last.fm data along with OpenAI's API to generate music personas for Last.fm users! While our main goal is to build and improve Persona.fm, we also aim to be a place that supports open-source contribution, especially for new contributors!

## Looking to contribute?

We welcome and encourage open source contributors! To get started, head over to our docs at [docs.personafm.com](https://docs.personafm.com) to learn how to set up this project locally! 

Additionally, you can check out our [contributing guide](https://github.com/personafm/.github/blob/main/contributing.md) to familiarize yourself with our contribution guidelines!

## First Contribution Repository

If you are new to open-source contribution, we reccommend that you check out our first-contribution repository to get a better understanding of how open-source contribution works and learn how to make your first contribution!
